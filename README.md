# TerminAlper
Simple serial terminal with filtering and port status tracking for Windows platform. Uses .NET 4.6.1 framework.

TerminAlper is based on Termie from David McClurg. 

These are some of the fixes and additions:
- Improved handling of port disconnects and reconnects.
- improved text box which now flickers much less than before.
- multiple filters and ability to change the filter delimiter
- Manual entry of COM ports, sometimes virtual COM ports don't show up.
- Detailed information display of USB bus reported device names.
- Ability to set maximum number of lines to keep track of.
- Connect-disconnect button now frees up COM port properly.
- Other small fixes that I forgot :)
